以下为介绍

This is a supervised learning task, where you have 'X_train.npy' containing a dataset of images (2 mnist digits). The label set 'y_train.npy' contains the labels of the bigger number out of the two.

Train a neural network to find the bigger number out of the two in the training sample.

Your performance will be evaluated based on the accuracy of your network on a **hidden** test dataset.
This page shows up underneath the data files.
